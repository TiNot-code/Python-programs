In this Repository are all my Single Python Files.

'hundediabetis.py' - is a Programm which transfers a given mmol value into the Insulin to inject. It has a TKinter GUI.

'pokemon.py' - is inspired by the Pokedle online Game, where you can guess a Pok√©mon. It uses the PokeAPI.

'rangegame.py' - was my first Python Program to get used to the Syntax. It is the classic 'Choose a number between 1 & x'.

'weather_shellscript.py' - is a programm which fetches the openmeteo weather API. It is included in myZSH and gives me the current temperature and precipitation.
