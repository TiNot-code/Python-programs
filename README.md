This repository contains several standalone Python scripts:

'diabetis_calculator.py' - A Tkinter GUI application that calculates the required insulin dose for dogs based on a given mmol blood sugar value.

'pokemon.py' - is inspired by the Pokedle online Game, where you can guess a Pok√©mon. It uses the PokeAPI.

'rangegame.py' - A simple number-guessing game ("Choose a number between 1 and X"). This was my first Python project, created to get familiar with basic syntax and logic.

'weather_shellscript.py' - is a programm which fetches the openmeteo weather API. It is included in myZSH and gives me the current temperature and precipitation.
